Experemental
============

Assets I am working on will be added to this repo

Assets are in their own folder, things in the root directory are general required files.

FILES UPLOADED SO FAR
------------------

People Bar: the unit selection menu. [WIP]
---
Add hooks for unit selection and subclass pictograms. With a little bit of grunge, this is almost ready for adding

Layer Selection: the layer selection menu. [WIP]
---
18/12/13: Works as intended. Draws the initial number of layers from length of array. Just add the layer creation code to the draw new layer code and the same with layer switching. All this needs is graphics.
